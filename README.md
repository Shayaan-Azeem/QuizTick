# QuizTick

Input the number of marks/questions to set a timer in accordance with the standard/standardized test you're preparing for. A small tick/nudge sound will indicate completion of each mark/question within the given time, and a timer beep will signal when the total time runs out! Enjoy using this tool to prepare for the SAT, ACT, or your IB exams.
